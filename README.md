# Signage Application and Admin

This project has two parts. The first part is the Firebase hosted admin web page. The second part is an OakOS application container that displays the Firebase data that the admin page stores for a gallery.

## Firebase Admin Web Page

Go to the [Admin Page](https://signage.zivelo.com). Once you login with either a Google hosted account or just a plain email, your data produced by this web page will be stored under your own user identification (api key). That api key will be displayed on the default web page.

Next, create a gallery and set any needed settings.

You can now add slides. Any delay settings applied to an individual slide will override the default delay in the gallery settings.
